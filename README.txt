A way to filter posts by authors from the dashboard and set the author of individual posts.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you filter the posts and any CPT from the dashboard. Additionally, if the post type supports author metabox, this plugin will also transform the select field. Note that this plugin uses select2 library so it might cause conflicts with other plugins. Compatible with ACF.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin either from the dashboard or via ftp.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it, it will automatically be added. I'm planning on extending the features when I have free time.

That means one of your plugins uses select2 library. I already made a fix for ACF plugin but your other plugins might be using select2 library. You can edit the plugin file to exclude this plugin select2 library.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
